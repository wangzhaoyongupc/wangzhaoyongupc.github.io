I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of UPC](https://www.upc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and person ReID.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yujie Liu](https://computer.upc.edu.cn/2017/0313/c6287a103939/page.htm) of The Graphics and Visualization Research Group from [China University of Petroleum Huadong](https://www.upc.edu.cn/).
